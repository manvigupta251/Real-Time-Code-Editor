# Real-Time-Code-Editor



In this project multiple users can code together, edit code snippets, and solve technical interviews in real-time. The editor supports real-time updates, user tracking, and room creation. In this you can also create a dynamic editor for a room, allowing users to write code in the React component and edit it in real-time within the Node.js server.
